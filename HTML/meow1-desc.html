        Popular since the 19th century, this cat breed originated in Thailand
        <br> (formerly known as Siam).
        The Siamese has been a
        foundational breed for the
        <br> Oriental shorthair, sphynx, and Himalayan.
        <br><br> Most Siamese cats have
        distinct markings called
        "points" that are the areas of coloration on their face, ears, feet, and tail. Two varieties
        of
        Siamese cats have an
        "apple" shaped head and chubbier body and the other features a larger head and slender body.
        <br><br>Many
        Siamese cats that originated from Thailand had a kink in their tailâ€”a trait bred out of most
        Siamese, but you can still
        see it in street cats in Thailand.
