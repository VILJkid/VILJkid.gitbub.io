        Bengals are wild-looking cats—literally. Their markings make them look
        <br> more like they belong in the jungle
        rather than
        in your home, but they are domesticated.
        <br><br> They are talkative and require a lot of exercise. They come in many
        colors with
        patterns like spots and rosettes. Their name comes from the Asian leopard cat’s taxonomic name, Prionailurus
        bengalensis.
        <br><br> Bengals were initially bred from domestic cats and a wildcat. They also get their beautiful
        patterns from
        this wildcat.
