        Also lovingly referred to as one of the "smushed-face" cats, the Iranian cat
        <br> or Shiraz cat (named for a city in
        Iran),
        Persians have beautiful, long fur coats.
        <br><br>
        They can come in almost any color and have a flat face when compared to
        most
        other breeds of cats. Persians are featured in many movies, artworks, and commercials and have been one of the
        most
        popular breeds of cats for decades.
        <br><br> Their coats demand regular grooming, otherwise, matting will result. Like
        many
        purebreds, they are prone to a variety of diseases, including renal and cardiac problems.
